# Poker_Game
 This is a Poker Game I made for fun that turned into my Computer Science High School Final, I wrote it in Python and used Tkinter to make it. 
 This is also the first time im using GitHub so if you see anything wrong feel free to point it out.
 Yes I know this code could be WAYYY more orginzied I started this project at the begining of 2021, I have learned a lot more since.

 Old_Code is the code I initally wrote in the first quarter of 2021 but then was later revised and I deleted the man function of it because I couldn't understand what I was reading lol. So it kind of works but it is missing some code, it is what I used to recode the game that you see in Main.py
