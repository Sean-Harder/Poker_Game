 This is a Poker Game I made for fun that turned into my Computer Science High School Final, I write it in Python and used Tkinter to make it. 
 This is also the first time im using GitHub so if you see anything wrong feel free to point it out
 Yes I know this code could be WAYYY more orginzied I started this project at the begining of 2021, I have learned a lot more since.
